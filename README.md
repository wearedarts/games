# Games

Landing page for selecting a game [https://darts-games.netlify.app/](https://darts-games.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

The `/src` directory contains plain HTML and CSS files, and asset directories. You can edit or serve these locally however you like.

### Example with hot reloading

```
cd src
npx lite-server
```

## Deployment

A `build` command copies the contents of `/src` to `/build` to allow CI to have something to run.
